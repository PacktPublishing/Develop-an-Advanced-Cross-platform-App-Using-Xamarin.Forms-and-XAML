## About the Video Course
Xamarin.Forms. is one of the most powerful cross-platform mobile development frameworks for creating stunning cross-platform applications with the iOS and Android mobile platforms. XAML (eXtensible Application Markup Language) allows developers to define user interfaces in Xamarin.Forms applications using markup rather than code.

This video course begins by showing you how to write a Medicine Tracking app using Xamarin.Forms and SQLite for data handling. This application will allow you to track your daily medications. You will also walk through the MVVM architectural pattern and the Xamarin.Forms Navigation API, before creating the Navigation Service Interface and class that will be used to navigate between your view models. You will then set up the solution for your project, write the shared business logic used across the application, and write an introduction to SQLite. Towards the end of the course, you will master the Xamarin.Forms platform architecture, and then write the user interface for your application, bind it to the UI, and delve more deeply into XAML and how data-binding works in Xamarin.Forms
